    Align two labels layers.

    This function aligns two label layers by examining the labels in `labels_layer_1`
    and identifying their maximum overlap with labels in `labels_layer_2`.
    It then updates the labels in `labels_layer_1`, reassigning them to match the corresponding overlapping label values from `labels_layer_2`.
    If there is no overlap with a label from `labels_layer_1` with `label_layer_2`, the label in `labels_layer_1` is set to zero.
    The function can also generate a shapes layer based on the resulting `output_labels_layer`.
    The layers are identified by their names and must exist within the SpatialData object passed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sdata
        The spatial data object containing the labels layers to be aligned.
    labels_layer_1
        The name of the first labels layer to align.
    labels_layer_2
        The name of the second labels layer to align.
    depth
        The depth around the boundary of each block to load when the array is split into blocks
        (for alignment). This ensures that the split isn't causing misalignment along the edges.
        Default is 100. Please set depth>cell size to avoid chunking effects.
    chunks
        The desired chunk size for the Dask computation in 'y' and 'x', or "auto" to allow the function to
        choose an optimal chunk size based on the data. Default is "auto".
    output_labels_layer
        The name for the new labels layer generated after alignment. If None and overwrite is False,
        a ValueError is raised. If None and overwrite is True, 'labels_layer_1' will be overwritten
        with the aligned layer. Default is None.
    output_shapes_layer
        The name for the new shapes layer generated from the aligned labels layer. If None, no shapes
        layer is created. Default is None.
    scale_factors
        Scale factors to apply for multiscale.
    overwrite
        If True, allows the function to overwrite the data in `output_labels_layer` and `output_shapes_layer` with the aligned data.
    iou_depth
        iou depth used for linking labels.
    iou_threshold
        iou threshold used for linking labels.

    Returns
    -------
    The modified spatial data object with the aligned labels layer.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the shapes of the label arrays or their translations do not match.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function works with Dask arrays and can handle large datasets that don't fit into memory.
    - Only arrays with the same shape are supported for alignment. Misaligned arrays could be due to
      various reasons, including errors in previous processing steps or physical shifts in the samples.
    - The alignment respects the original labelling but ensures that corresponding areas in both layers
      match after the process.
