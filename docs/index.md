Why Harpy?

- **Multi-platform support** for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data.
- **Interoperable outputs** built on [SpatialData](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata).
- **Scales to (very) large images**: tiled workflows with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/); optional GPU acceleration with [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- **End-to-end workflows** for segmentation, feature extraction, clustering, and spatial analysis.

Explore how to use Harpy for segmentation, shallow and deep feature extraction, clustering, and spatial analysis of gigapixel-scale multiplexed data with these step-by-step notebooks:

---

- **🚀 Basic Usage of Harpy**

  Learn how to read in data, perform **tiled segmentation** using [**Cellpose**](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) and [**Dask-CUDA**](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cuda/stable/), extract features, and carry out clustering. 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/general/Harpy_feature_calculation.ipynb)

---

- **🔧 Technology specific advice**

  Learn which technologies Harpy supports. 👉 [Notebook](../docs/tutorials/general/techno_specific.ipynb)

---

- **🧩 Pixel and Cell Clustering**

  Learn how to perform unsupervised pixel- and cell-level clustering using `Harpy` together with [**FlowSOM**](https://github.com/saeyslab/FlowSOM_Python). 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/general/FlowSOM_for_pixel_and_cell_clustering.ipynb)

---

- **✂️ Cell Segmentation**

  Explore segmentation workflows in `Harpy` using different tools:
  - With [**Instanseg**](https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg) 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/general//Harpy_instanseg.ipynb)

  - With [**Cellpose**](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) 👉 [Tutorial ](../docs/tutorials/general/Harpy_feature_calculation.ipynb)

---

- **🧪 Single-cell representations from highly multiplexed images and downstream use with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**

  Learn how single-cell representations can be generated from highly multiplexed images. These representations can then be used downstream to train classifiers in PyTorch. 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/general/generate_single_cell_representations.ipynb)

---

- **🧠 Deep Feature Extraction**

  Discover how `Harpy` enables fast, scalable extraction of deep, cell-level features from highly multiplex imaging data with the [**KRONOS**](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS) foundation model for proteomics. 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/general/Featurize_with_kronos.ipynb)

  💡 Want us to add support for another deep feature extraction method?
  👉 [Open an issue](https://github.com/saeyslab/harpy/issues) and let us know!

---

- **🔬 Shallow Feature Extraction**

  Learn to extract shallow features—such as **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** of intensities—from multiplex imaging data with `Harpy`. 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/advanced/Harpy_aggregate_rasters.ipynb)

---

- **🧬 Spatial Transcriptomics**

  Learn how to analyze spatial transcriptomics data with `Harpy`. For detailed information, refer to the [**SPArrOW documentation**](https://sparrow-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

  👉 [Tutorial (Mouse Liver, Resolve Molecular Cartography)](../docs/tutorials/advanced/Harpy_transcriptomics.ipynb)

  👉 [Tutorial (Human Ovarian Cancer, Xenium 10x Genomics)](../docs/tutorials/advanced/Harpy_transcriptomics_xenium.ipynb)

---

- **🌐 Multiple samples and coordinate systems**

  Learn how to work with multiple samples, instrinsic and micron coordinates. 👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/advanced/coordinate_systems.ipynb)

---

- **📐 Unifying Raster and Vector Annotations**

  Learn how to convert a segmentation mask (array) into its vectorized form, and segmentation boundaries (polygons) into their rasterized equivalents. This conversion is useful, for example, when integrating annotations (e.g., from [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/)) into downstream spatial omics analysis.👉 [Tutorial](../docs/tutorials/advanced/Rasterize_and_vectorize.ipynb)
